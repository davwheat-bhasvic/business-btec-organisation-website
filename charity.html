          <h2>WaterAid's origin and sector</h2>
          <!-- 1a -->
          <p>
            <strong>WaterAid</strong> is an international non-profit
            organisation operating in the
            <strong>secondary and tertiary sectors</strong>, manufacturing and
            supplying products and services to disadvantaged people and families
            internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            A charity (or charitable trust) is an organisation that does not aim
            to make any profits (any excess money made in a financial year is
            called a suplus, not a profit), and all proceeds go towards
            fulfilling their charitable mission, aims and objectives. As a
            result, governments provide them with lower tax rates than normal
            businesses in almost all areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some risks come along with being a charity, as they must be more
            clear about surplusses and provide a much greater level of detail to
            the public and government about their finances due to the benefits
            they have (such as reduced taxation). This is done to prevent
            charities exploiting the rules and actually making profits which are
            given to their directors. If charities do not report enough
            information, the government can immediately revoke their charity
            license with almost no warning.
          </p>

          <!-- 1c -->
          <p>
            WaterAid began in 1981 as a result of the United Nations
            International Drinking Water decade, with projects in Sri Lanka and
            Zambia, as a join project between members of the UK water industry
            during the Thirsty Third World Conference.

          <h2>Tax reductions for charities</h2>

          <h3>VAT</h3>

          <p>
            Charities do not have to pay any VAT on the sale of goods donated to
            them by the general public, so long as the items have been "made
            available to the general public, or to 2 or more persons who are
            disabled or receiving certain means tested benefits". This allows a
            larger proportion of revenue to be dedicated to charitable missions.
            VAT must still be paid on most items purchased by charities.
          </p>

          <h3>Gift aid</h3>

          <p>
            Monetary donations made to charities are not taxed at all under the
            UK government's "Gift Aid" programme. In addition, individuals who
            make donations to charities registered for Gift Aid with HMRC can
            reclaim the Income Tax on the amount which they donate, which can
            act as an incentive for people earning large amounts of money (and
            thus paying large amounts of income tax).
          </p>

          <h3>Charitable expenditure</h3>

          <p>
            No taxes need to be paid on profits earned by charities on the
            services or products they provide, nor on purchasing or selling
            assets and property, as long as these surpluses are used for
            charitable purposes. Charities also pay 80% lower business rates
            (taxes from the local council for running a business out of a given
            property) on non-domestic properties. From the 2016/17 financial
            year and later, dividends earned from UK companies are also not
            taxed.

          <p>
            WaterAid's mission is to provide easy access to clean water,
            improved sanitation (handling of waste water and sewage), and proper
            hygiene for everyone around the world, because without access to all
            three, people are at risk of bacterial and viral infections, such as
            cholera, impacting their ability to live a healthy and happy life.

          <p>
            Since 1981, WaterAid have completed many projects, including the
            largest single water supply scheme in Ethopia (Hitosa Gravity
            Scheme, 1993), advocating for the United Nations to
            <strong>declare access to clean water as a human right</strong>, and
            they have
            <strong>

          <h2>Supporting WaterAid and their product portfolio</h2>
          <!-- 1e -->
          <p>
            You can support WaterAid in many ways, including purchasing products
            on behalf of those in need from their
            <a
              href="https://shop.wateraid.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"

          </p>
          <!-- 1f -->
          <p>
            You can pay for an item which directly helps someone in need, such
            as a toilet, water tank, handwashing station, or a water collection
            station. Purchasing one of these items from their store will
            directly allow WaterAid to provide one to a family or neighbourhood
            in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            The products appeal to people who feel a desire to help others.
            Purchasing them only grants you a card stating that you've helped
            other people (e.g. providing a set of taps, a water collection
            system, emptying a school toilet, and more), rather than a physical
            product for your own use. This allows as much money as possible to
            go directly towards WaterAid's aid mission: providing their clean
            water and hygiene services to those in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also take part in
            <strong>"Coast Along for WaterAid"</strong>, which is their annual
            sponsored walk.
          </p>
          <!-- 1f -->
          <p>
            The majority of WaterAid's revenue comes from individual donations,
            government grants, and purchases like these. All their revenue is
            used to fund their charitable mission, aims and objectives.

          <h2>WaterAid worldwide</h2>
          <!-- 1l -->
          <p>
            WaterAid operates around the world in a multitude of countries. Its
            main headquarters are in London, but they also have head offices in
            the USA, Australia, Sweden, Canada, Japan and India.
          </p>
          <!-- 1m -->
          <p>
            As of September 2020, WaterAid has approximately 1200 countries
            across over 35 countries. Employee diveristy is high within WaterAid
            due to the large number of cultures and areas of operation, which
            allows the charity to more closely work with and understand local
            needs in the areas which they provide their charitable services and
            activities. The director of organisational development, Rachel
            Wescott, told People Management UK that, "I’ve talked to a number of
            trustees who’ve said they haven’t worked with another organisation
            that lives its values quite like WaterAid," when asked about how
            employees feel while working at the charity.
          </p>
          <!-- 1o -->
          <p>
            WaterAid needs this large number of employees and offices because
            they are a worldwide charity, providing their not-for-profit
            services across tens of countries in need, as well as increasing
            awareness of the charity in local areas. As a result, WaterAid gains
            access to increased funding capability from the public and local
            corporations.

        <h2>Financial analysis</h2>

        <h3>2020 to 2021</h3>

        <p>
          Over the last financial year, from 2020 to 2021, WaterAid's income
          fell by only 1.9%, a remarkable feat during a global pandemic. At the
          start of the pandemic, WaterAid had estimated a possible shortfall of
          approximately £10 million, but the actual shortfall was only £1.75
          million.
        </p>

        <img src="wateraid-finances-2020-21.png" />

        <h3>2019 to 2020</h3>

        <p>
          Betwen 2019 and 2020, WaterAid's income was approximately £91.3
          million, with them spending 76p for every £1 on fulfilling their aims
          and objectives, with the remaining 24p dedicated to future fundraising
          for the charity. This 76:24 split is common throughout the last 3
          financial years, and WaterAid attempt to keep as close to this split
          as possible, as it has so far resulted in continuous and sustainable
          charity growth, while not affecting their ability to meet their
          objectives and aims.

        <h2>WaterAid's success</h2>

        <p>
          WaterAid measure their success with a multitude of different aims and
          objectives. Their overall mission is to provide clean water, better
          hygeine standard and toilets to everyone around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The WaterAid Foundation has been successful in expanding their
          activities internationally and to more people than ever before.
          Between 2019 and 2020, WaterAid spent a total of £30.78 million on
          delivering water, sanitation and hygeine products and services
          globally. The large majority of this was through their partners. This
          has increased by £6.83 million from £23.95 during the 2018-19
          financial year. This significant increase is attributed to delivering
          WaterAid's new programmes, which they had secured long-term funding
          for in the previous financial year. WaterAid's activities has allowed
          them to supply 6000 people with clean water in Bauchi State in
          Nigeria, along with improving sanitation for 10000 households, and
          15000 people via improving the primary healthcare facilities in Dewu
          and Kafin Iya. All of these benefit the charity's long-term mission
          statement of providing clean water, hygiene and sanitation to all.
        </p>

        <p>
          WaterAid have also been successful in raising capital for their
          sanitation and clean water projects from all sectors. Across the last
          few financial years, the vast majority of WaterAid's funding has come
          from individual supporters (approx. £48.7 million), followed by
          corporate contributions and governments (£17.1 and £11.9 million
          respectively). Their income has remained stable, allowing them to
          predict the amount of funding they will have each year, leaving a
          smaller safety-net in case of unexpected issues.
