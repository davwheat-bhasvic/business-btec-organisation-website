          <!-- 1a -->
          <p>
            WaterAid's is a registered charity in the UK in the secondary and
            tertiary sectors, supplying products and services to disadvantaged
            people and families.

          <p>
            WaterAid began in 1981 as a result of the United Nations
            International Drinking Water decade, with projects in Sri Lanka and
            Zambia, as a join project between members of the UK water industry
            during the Thirsty Third World Conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to provide easy access to clean water, improved
            sanitation (handling of waste water and sewage), and proper hygiene
            for everyone around the world.

            Since 1981, we've completed many projects, including the largest
            single water supply scheme in Ethopia (Hitosa Gravity Scheme, 1993),
            advocating for the United Nations to declare access to clean water
            as a human right, and provided 27 million people with clean water
            and toilets.

            In 2020, we scaled up hand-washing efforts in 18 different countries
            due to the Coronavirus pandemic. In March this year (2021),

        <h2>Financial information</h2>

        <p>
          Over the last financial year, from 2020 to 2021, WaterAid's income
          fell by only 1.9%, a remarkable feat during a global pandemic. At the
          start of the pandemic, WaterAid had estimated a possible shortfall of
          approximately £10 million, but the actual shortfall was only £1.75
          million.
