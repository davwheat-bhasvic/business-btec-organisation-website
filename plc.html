          <h2>AstraZeneca's origin and sector</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> is a British-Swedish multinational
            public limited company, headquartered in Cambridge, UK. It operates
            in the secondary and quaternary sectors, producing pharmaceutical
            products (such as the recent COVID-19 vaccinations), as well as
            performing scientific research.
          </p>
          <p>
            AstraZeneca was founded through the merger between the Swedish and
            British pharmaceutical companies Astra AB and Zeneca Group. It is
            currently among the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and
            has such purchased many smaller related companies, such as Cambridge
            Antibody Technology, MedImmune and Spirogen.

          <h2>Public limited companies (PLCs)</h2>

          <p>
            A public limited company is an organisation that is publicly traded
            on a stock exchange. On the stock exchange, people can trade shares
            (very small ownership stake) of the company between each other in
            exchange for money. The main benefit of a PLC is that investors are
            only at risk of losing what they have invested, which is called
            limited liability.
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone owns a share in a business, they own part of that
            business, and are entitled to dividends (portion of the company's
            annual profits), and to the right to vote in shareholder meetings.
            These shares, however, are one easy way for the PLC to generate
            extra revenue, as they receive the money which the share is sold
            for.
          </p>
          <p>
            PLCs have some disadvantages, however. For example, anyone with a
            majority share of the company (e.g. controls over 50% of the shares)
            technically owns the company as a whole, as they can ensure that
            votes are always found in their favour due to that majority. This
            makes PLCs much more exposed to unexpected takeover attempts by
            their rivals.

          <h2>AstraZeneca worldwide</h2>

          <p>

            They have 93 locations across the world, with 44 locations
            throughout Europe (spanning 30 countries), with 12 in the UK alone.

            AstraZeneca benefit from this wide range of locations and high count
            of employees through their ability to recruit greater numbers of
            highly skilled workers in the required fields (biology and
            medicine), resulting in them being more easily able to conduct their
            life-saving research due to a greater range of knowledge throughout
            the organisation as a whole.
