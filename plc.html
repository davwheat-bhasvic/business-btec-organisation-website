          <h2>AstraZeneca's origin and sector</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> is a British-Swedish multinational
            public limited company, headquartered in Cambridge, UK. It operates
            in the secondary and quaternary sectors, producing pharmaceutical
            products (such as the recent COVID-19 vaccinations), as well as
            performing scientific research.
          </p>
          <p>
            AstraZeneca was founded through the merger between the Swedish and
            British pharmaceutical companies Astra AB and Zeneca Group. It is
            currently among the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and
            has such purchased many smaller related companies, such as Cambridge
            Antibody Technology, MedImmune and Spirogen.

          <h2>Public limited companies (PLCs)</h2>

          <p>
            A public limited company is an organisation that is publicly traded
            on a stock exchange. On the stock exchange, people can trade shares
            (very small ownership stake) of the company between each other in
            exchange for money. The main benefit of a PLC is that investors are
            only at risk of losing what they have invested, which is called
            limited liability.
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone owns a share in a business, they own part of that
            business, and are entitled to dividends (portion of the company's
            annual profits), and to the right to vote in shareholder meetings.
            These shares, however, are one easy way for the PLC to generate
            extra revenue, as they receive the money which the share is sold
            for.
          </p>
          <p>
            PLCs have some disadvantages, however. For example, anyone with a
            majority share of the company (e.g. controls over 50% of the shares)
            technically owns the company as a whole, as they can ensure that
            votes are always found in their favour due to that majority. This
            makes PLCs much more exposed to unexpected takeover attempts by
            their rivals.

          <h2>Products</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> are most well-known for their recent
            participation in the fight against the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-19 or
            COVID-19). For this, they partnered with Oxford University to
            produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinations, which were very widely
            used in the UK.
          </p>
          <p>
            AstraZeneca have also produced a vast range of other pharmaceutical
            products, relating to (in order of sales revenue): cancer treatments
            ($10.9bn), cardiovascular diseases ($7.1bn), and respiratory
            illnesses ($5.4bn).
          </p>
          <p>
            Their products attempt to fulfill their organisational mission, aims
            and objectives, all trying to prevent life-changing illnesses via
            medications and inoculations. The products are aimed towards those
            in need of medical treatment, and for medical organisations such as
            the National Health Service (NHS).

          <h2>AstraZeneca worldwide</h2>

          <p>
            AstraZeneca is a global company, with its headquarters in Cambridge.
            They have 93 locations across the world, with 44 locations
            throughout Europe (spanning 30 countries), with 12 in the UK alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Across all locations, AZ have
            <strong>76,100 employees as of 2020</strong>, which was a 7.8%
            increase over 2019's total of 70,600. Diveristy is a big factor in
            AztraZeneca's employees, with
            <strong>46.9% of senior roles filled by women</strong>. 81% of
            employees believe that there is effective collaboration between
            teams inside AstraZeneca.
          </p>

          <p>
            AstraZeneca benefit from this wide range of locations and high count
            of employees through their ability to recruit greater numbers of
            highly skilled workers in the required fields (biology and
            medicine), resulting in them being more easily able to conduct their
            life-saving research due to a greater range of knowledge throughout
            the organisation as a whole.

        <h2>Financial analysis</h2>
        <h3>2020 vs 2019</h3>

        <p>
          AstraZeneca had a much stronger financial year in 2020 compared to
          other PLCs. Their total revenue (money flowing into the business) was
          $26.6bn in 2020, which was an increase of approximately 10% over 2019
          revenue ($24.4bn). Furthermore, their operating profits were 81%
          higher, at $5.2bn compared to $2.9bn in 2019 and $3.4bn in 2018.
        </p>

        <p>
          AstraZeneca's increased revenue and profits may be seen as a result of
          the Coronavirus pandemic. However, during this, they
          <em>donated</em> PPE to companies and governments, rather than selling
          them. They also manufactured Oxford's Coronavirus vaccines, and sold
          them to the UK, India, Sweden and some European countries, but aiming
          to make zero or no profit on the sales whatsoever.

        <p>
          In fact, AstraZeneca's main revenue growth in 2020 was from their
          oncology (cancer research and treatment) department, which grew by 25%
          from $8.6bn to $10.9bn. Overall, product sales increased by 10% to
          $26.6bn, with 52% of this being from sales of their new
          medicines<sup>1</sup>.

        <h2>AstraZeneca's success</h2>

        <p>
          AstraZeneca measures its success via how well it achieves its top
          priorities each year. Its official mission is to provide
          pharmaceutical products to cure debilitating conditions affecting
          people around the world. This year, it has definitely worked towards
          this mission with its aims and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          AZ's COVID-19 vaccinations have helped to meet this goal. The COVID-19
          pandemic is the most widespread infection in the last 100 years,
          killing 4.55 million people globally since it began. Vaccinations help
          to reduce the risk of infection, along with the severity of symptoms
          if an infection takes place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their vaccination programme was designed not to make any profits,
          meaning that any surplus made would be reinvested back into the
          vaccination programme rather than being paid to investors. This showed
          that their efforts were an attempt to make a difference in the world,
          rather than a pure money-making scheme. Their aim for this programme
          may have been to receive good PR for their deeds, but the rare side
          effects as a result of the vaccine (blood clots), along with the
          exaggeration by media, has meant that they have actually received bad
          PR.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to their vaccinations, AstraZeneca have launched a total
          of 13 new medicines in 2020, further progressing towards their mission
          statement. Approximately 30% of their total product sales revenue was
          in emerging markets, too, where even simple medication can make a
          massive difference to people's livelihoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, AstraZeneca has significantly increased its profits (up
          by 81% on 2019), due to significant increases in sales revenue from
          their pharmaceutical products. This can be seen as a positive for the
          company as a whole, and its shareholders, who received a total of
          $3.57bn in dividends in 2020. The dividend payout was a slight
          decrease on 2019, where the overall total was $3.59bn, but this is
          almost negligible. Additionally, AstraZeneca's share price has
          increased from approximately £53.71 per share in Jan 2019 to £88.26 in
          October 2021.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Overall, I would argue that AstraZeneca have achieved their aims and
          significantly progressed towards their mission in 2020 and 21H1. Their
          charitable actions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic have allowed
          vaccine doses to be distributed at much lower cost (approximately
          £2.17/£1.56 per dose in UK and EU respectively) to countries which may
          not be able to afford the more expensive Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna
          vaccines (approximately £15 and £24 per dose respectively), helping to
          fulfill their overall mission and aim.
